00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,173
clip for that source to play.

76
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,853

80
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,734
and automatically reference the dragged audio clip.
然后自动引用拖拽过来的音频剪辑

81
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,455
Let's see this in action.
让我们来实践一下

82
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,955

84
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,053
To drag an asset like our audio clip
但是如果把一个音频剪辑资源拖拽到

85
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,136
on to a prefab asset
预制件的资源当中并不能这样操作

86
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,136
which both are in our project
因为他们都在我们的项目视图中

87
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,829
we can either open 2 Project view windows
我们可以通过打开2个项目视图窗口来完成操作

88
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,654
or we can change our existing Project view

from one part of our Project view to another
从项目视图中把资源来回拖拽

101
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:41,311
With the explosion_steroid prefab selected
explosion_steroid预制件已经被选定的情况下

102
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,059
drag the explosion_asteroid audio clip
将explosion_asteroid的音频剪辑

103
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:47,664
on to the game object on the Inspector and drop it.
拖拽到对象的查看窗口并松开鼠标

104
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,924
We can see that Unity has added an

For our explosions to work properly in our game
为了使我们的爆炸可以在游戏中正常的执行

116
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,924
we need to make sure that it is set on.
我们需要确保这个选项被勾选

117
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:25,187
This way the audio will play automatically
这样在产生这个爆炸的时候

118
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,187
when we spawn our explosion.
这个音频就会被自动播放

119
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:31,234
We can also drag an audio clip on to a
我们也可以把一个音频剪辑

120
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:33,068
prefab asset without having it
不通过查看器窗口

121
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,068
visable in the Inspector.
拖拽到预制件资源上

122
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,683
Select the explosion_player audio clip
选定explosion_player剪辑

123
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:42,686
and drag it on to the explosion_player prefab asset.
把它拖拽到explosion_player预制件上

124
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,206
As we are using the defaults as they are
因为默认就是Play On Awake

125
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:48,749
with Play On Awake automatically set
已经被自动选定了

126
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,467
we don't need to make any changes to this at all.

127
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,046
Now the player's weapon sound is almost as simple.

的玩家对象上

131
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,890
Again we can see that Unity has added
我们可以看到Unity 

132
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,483
an audio source to the player game object
又一次帮我们把音频源

133
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,873
and the audio clip reference is set to
添加到了玩家对象上并对weapon_player

134
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,134
weapon_player.
做了引用

135
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,765
The player however has just a few more
这里玩家有几点需要

136
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,209
items to consider.
特别注意

137
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,302
First we definately do not want Play On Awake set.
第一,Play On Awake这个选项不要勾选

138
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:23,302
Otherwise we would get our weapon sound playing
否则我们在游戏一开始的时候

139
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,535
on the very first frame of the game.
就会听到物体的声音

140
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,035
Deselect Play On Awake.
去掉Play On Awake的勾选

141
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,380
Now if we won't be playing this sound automatically
如果我们不让声音自动产生

142
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,037
how will we play it?
那应该让声音何时播放?

143
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:38,008
We must do this from our PlayerController script.
我们需要在PlayerController脚本中处理

144
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,985
So select the player controller script
选定player controller脚本

145
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:43,955
and open it for editing.
打开编辑

146
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,493
Looking at our PlayerController script
浏览一下我们的PlayerController脚本

147
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,493
where do we want to write our code?
我们的代码该加在哪里呢?

148
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:55,988
In our Update function where we fire our shot.
写在Update函数中这里我们发射子弹

149
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,944
As all of the logic will be
所有的逻辑将会被

150
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,944
executed within the same frame
在同一帧中执行

151
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,693
practically it doesn't make a difference
因此在这段代码的

152
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,421
where in the block we write our new line
什么位置新增代码

153
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:08,826
as long as it is inside the if statement.
并没有什么区别,只要在这段

154
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,592
controlling when we fire our weapons.
控制武器发射的if条件内的添加新代码

155
