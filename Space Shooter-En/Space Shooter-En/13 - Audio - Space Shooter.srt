1
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:03,287
Our game is taking shape.

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:06,236
The game play is pretty much finished.

3
00:00:06,236 --> 00:00:08,042
Now it's time to polish our game

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,042
and get it ready to build.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,130
Next we're going to be adding audio,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,130
sound effects and music.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,053
There are 3 main audio components in Unity.

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,340
There are audio clips, audio sources

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,089
and the audio listener.

10
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,813
We will concentrate on audio clips

11
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,813
and audio sources.

12
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,797
For more details on these 3 audio components

13
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,977
please see the information linked below.

14
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:38,247
Audio clips hold our audio data

15
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,136
or sound files.

16
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:44,233
Audio sources play our audio clips in the scene.

17
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:47,285
Let's find our audio clips.

18
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,587
In Assets we have an Audio folder.

19
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:52,893
Here we can see a selection of sound

20
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,893
effects and a music track.

21
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:58,963
If we select any 1 of the audio clips

22
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:00,963
we will see that clip's import settings

23
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:02,504
in the Inspector.

24
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:05,173
The Preview window will display additional

25
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:07,173
information about that clip.

26
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:10,052
If the Preview window has been closed

27
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:12,052
we can drag the Preview window's header

28
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:14,052
bar up to reopen it.

29
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,967
In the Preview window we can see

30
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,967
the audio clip's waveform,

31
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:21,207
we can play,

32
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,597
or loop the audio clip's audio file,

33
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,826
and we get additional information about

34
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:34,489
that audio clip printed at the bottom.

35
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:38,741
We won't cover the details of the audio importer.

36
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,187
For more information on the audio importer

37
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:43,187
please see the links below.

38
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,700
We do want to note one important import

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,810
setting here however, and that is 3D Sound.

40
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,127
For our game we want to make sure

41
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:57,731
all of our audio clips have 3D sound deselected.

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
This should already be set properly on the

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,491
assets provided with this project.

44
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:06,811
When an audio clip is imported as a 3D sound

45
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,811
Unity will compare the location

46
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,862
of the audio source playing the audio clip

47
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,862
and compare it with the scene's

48
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:15,624
1 active audio listener

49
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,372
and use the relative positions

50
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,901
to affect the clip's volume and panning.

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
We don't want any of this working in our

52
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,190
simple arcade-style game.

53
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,190
So we want to make sure 3D Sound

54
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,190
has been deselected.

55
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:33,215
The audio files that we have in this project

56
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,853
are 3 styles of explosions,

57
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:38,706
Asteroid, Enemy and Player.

58
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,206
A backgound music track.

59
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,609
And 2 weapons effects.

60
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,920
In this portion of the Space Shooter project

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,438
we will be ignoring the Enemy sounds,

62
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:52,675
they are for later optional assignments.

63
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,156
We need to associate an audio clip with

64
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:59,556
our explosion prefabs and our player ship.

65
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,927
The explosions need to play their audio clip

66
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,792
when they are first instantiated in to the scene.

67
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,416
The player ship on the other hand needs

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,833
to play it's audio clip when the player

69
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,405
fires their weapons.

70
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:14,905
We associate an audio clip with a

71
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:18,086
game object by using an audio source component.

72
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:21,309
The audio source plays an audio clip.

73
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,058
We can add an audio source component

74
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:27,173
to our game objects and then reference an audio

75
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,173
clip for that source to play.

76
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,853
But there is an easier way to do this.

77
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:34,173
If we drag an audio clip on to

78
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,889
a game object Unity will create

79
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,617
a new audio source on the game object

80
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,734
and automatically reference the dragged audio clip.

81
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,455
Let's see this in action.

82
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,955
We can drag assets easily from our

83
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:51,852
Project view on to game objects in our Hierarchy.

84
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,053
To drag an asset like our audio clip

85
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,136
on to a prefab asset

86
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,136
which both are in our project

87
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,829
we can either open 2 Project view windows

88
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,654
or we can change our existing Project view

89
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:08,097
from using the 2 column layout

90
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,695
to using a single column layout.

91
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,034
This will allow us to drag objects

92
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,562
from one part of our Project view to another

93
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,405
without losing focus on our target asset.

94
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:22,236
Our first target asset will be the

95
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,584
asteroid explosion prefab.

96
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,137
Our asteroid hazards have a reference

97
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,916
to this prefab.

98
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,012
When we destroy the asteroid

99
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,345
the asteroid will spawn this prefab.

100
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:36,727
At that point we want it to go bang.

101
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:41,311
With the explosion_steroid prefab selected

102
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,059
drag the explosion_asteroid audio clip

103
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:47,664
on to the game object on the Inspector and drop it.

104
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,924
We can see that Unity has added an

105
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,835
audio source to the prefab asset

106
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,835
and that audio source has a reference

107
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,800
to the audio clip that we dragged and dropped on it.

108
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,832
The bulk of the component is dedicated

109
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,832
to 3D Sound settings,

110
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:07,332
which we can safely ignore.

111
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,929
The only important setting that we need to

112
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,929
worry about for our game here

113
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,374
is Play On Awake.

114
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,626
Play On Awake should be on by default.

115
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:20,128
For our explosions to work properly in our game

116
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,924
we need to make sure that it is set on.

117
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:25,187
This way the audio will play automatically

118
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,187
when we spawn our explosion.

119
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:31,234
We can also drag an audio clip on to a

120
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:33,068
prefab asset without having it

121
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,068
visable in the Inspector.

122
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,683
Select the explosion_player audio clip

123
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:42,686
and drag it on to the explosion_player prefab asset.

124
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,206
As we are using the defaults as they are

125
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:48,749
with Play On Awake automatically set

126
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,467
we don't need to make any changes to this at all.

127
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,046
Now the player's weapon sound is almost as simple.

128
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,644
Select the weapon_player audio clip

129
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:01,644
and drag it in to the Scene view

130
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,200
and drop it on to the player game object.

131
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,890
Again we can see that Unity has added

132
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,483
an audio source to the player game object

133
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,873
and the audio clip reference is set to

134
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,134
weapon_player.

135
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,765
The player however has just a few more

136
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,209
items to consider.

137
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,302
First we definately do not want Play On Awake set.

138
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:23,302
Otherwise we would get our weapon sound playing

139
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,535
on the very first frame of the game.

140
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,035
Deselect Play On Awake.

141
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,380
Now if we won't be playing this sound automatically

142
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,037
how will we play it?

143
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:38,008
We must do this from our PlayerController script.

144
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,985
So select the player controller script

145
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:43,955
and open it for editing.

146
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,493
Looking at our PlayerController script

147
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,493
where do we want to write our code?

148
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:55,988
In our Update function where we fire our shot.

149
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,944
As all of the logic will be

150
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,944
executed within the same frame

151
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,693
practically it doesn't make a difference

152
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,421
where in the block we write our new line

153
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:08,826
as long as it is inside the if statement.

154
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,592
controlling when we fire our weapons.

155
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:14,962
We will add this line of code to the

156
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,725
end of this block.

157
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:20,970
Write audio.Play with a capital P

158
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,970
followed by parenthesis.

159
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:25,705
Audio is the shorthand reference

160
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:27,705
that this script will use to talk

161
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:29,982
to the audio source attached to it.

162
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,989
And Play is a function on the audio source

163
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:36,044
that will play the current clip

164
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,321
and as a function needs to be called

165
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,321
with the parenthesis.

166
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:43,346
It is worth noting that we can change the

167
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,346
clips to be played and other

168
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:48,203
additional functionality all in code

169
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:50,203
but we won't be covering that here.

170
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,282
For more information on the audio source

171
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:55,712
or any of the other audio components 

172
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:58,174
please see the details linked below.

173
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:02,014
Now when we fire our weapon we instantiate

174
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,329
our shot clone and play our weapon sound.

175
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:09,234
Save this script, return to Unity,

176
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,949
save the scene and enter Play mode.

177
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,211
And we have sound effects.

178
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,321
Exit Play mode.

179
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:28,543
Along with our sound effects we also have a

180
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,392
background music track.

181
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:31,990
we can find this in our audio folder

182
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,560
as music_background.

183
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,570
Let's put this background music

184
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,612
on our game controller.

185
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:40,612
This audio track will be self sufficient

186
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,112
and won't need to interact with a

187
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,015
game controller at all.

188
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,015
It could go on it's own game object.

189
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,584
But the game controller's game object

190
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,762
is a tidy place to keep a component

191
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:53,012
that is related to the game in general.

192
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,132
Drag music_background in to our

193
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:59,180
Scene view and drop it on Game Controller.

194
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
This will add a new audio source

195
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,221
to Game Controller with music_background

196
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,710
as the referenced clip.

197
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,089
We want this music to start right away

198
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,660
and play during the entire game.

199
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
For this we want to make sure that

200
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,743
Play On Awake is selected

201
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:19,588
so it will begin playing on the first frame

202
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,279
and select Loop as well.

203
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,997
So the audio runs continuously.x

204
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,984
The audio clip is designed as a seamless loop

205
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,984
so there will be no audible gap when the

206
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,385
music continuously restarts.

207
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,481
Save the scene and enter Play mode.

208
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:50,857
Now we have sound effects and music.

209
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,130
Exit Play mode.

210
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,948
The last step we need to take is

211
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,781
balancing the audio.

212
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:00,781
All of the clips are currently being played back

213
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,029
at full volume, and they don't mix well.

214
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,796
Let's bring some of these effects down in volume.

215
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,779
Select the player game object and

216
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:13,210
bring up the audio source component.

217
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,295
Change the Volume property to 0.5.

218
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:20,295
This will reduce the strength of the

219
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,295
player's weapon sound.

220
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:25,414
Next select the Game Controller game object

221
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,175
and again on the audio component

222
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,424
reduce the volume property to 0.5.

223
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,531
Save the scene and enter Play mode.

224
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:54,281
Now the explosions are still bright and snappy

225
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,033
but the player's weapons and the background

226
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,834
music are not so overwhelming.

227
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,389
Excellent.

228
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,919
In the next assignment we will see how to

229
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,919
display a score.
